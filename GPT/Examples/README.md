# Script "Professor"
  
Added a GPTalk **sample** script that makes the chatbot a **very **didactic teacher !**

For example, teach how to use **programming libraries** or teach **Korean**. To do this, delete scripts line 20 and edit the first **four** lines of the **script** that define the **context variables** as follows:

    toTeach <- Korean
    context <-Languages
    role <- teacher
    Verb <- speak and write  

Look at the picture of **Korean professor** running perfectly!
